# Keystroke Logging Demonstration

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple, ethical, and controlled keystroke logging application using Python. It is designed for educational purposes to help users understand how keyboard inputs are captured, processed, and stored securely.

## Problem Statement

With the rising prevalence of cyber threats, understanding how keystroke logging works is crucial for cybersecurity awareness. However, many students and beginners in computer science struggle to find simple, ethical, and practical demonstrations that illustrate how keyboard inputs can be captured, processed, and stored securely. This lack of accessible learning tools limits their grasp of both the risks and defenses related to keystroke monitoring.

This project fills that gap by offering a clear, ethical, and controlled demonstration of keystroke logging using Python, helping learners explore the fundamentals of input event handling, data storage, and cybersecurity implications in a safe environment.

## Problem Description

The project implements a **GUI-based keystroke logging demonstration** using Python. The application features a simple graphical interface that allows users to **explicitly start and stop keystroke logging** at their discretion.

Captured keystrokes are stored locally in:  
- A plain text file for easy, human-readable logs  
- A JSON file for structured and machine-readable data

The system functions **only when the user activates logging**, ensuring ethical usage and full transparency.

This project demonstrates practical concepts such as GUI development, keyboard event handling with the `pynput` library, and effective file management for data storage.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x (e.g., Python 3.14)  
- `pynput` library for keyboard event handling  
- `logging` module for data storage  
- Virtual Environment (`venv`) for dependency management  
- Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as the code editor  
- PowerShell / Command Prompt for execution and environment management  

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/keystroke-logger-demo.git
